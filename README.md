This project explores fitness and workout program data to uncover patterns across goals, levels and equipment. It includes an exploratory data analysis with visual insights and machine learning component that predicts a program's goal using key features like program length, workout time, total exercises, and level. Built with Python, pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn, it demonstrates the full workflow of data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

It also features a classification pipeline using Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to compare predictive performance, supported by evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Feature importance analysis highlights which attributes most influcence workout goals, providing interpretability alongside performance.
